GO Lang Notes:


package main //every go program starts only with package .... main is name of the package, it can be different as well


import "fmt" //import fmt package to use it's methods and functions in our program

func main() // this is the main function of our program
{
	//fmt.Println("Hello, Priyansh! Welcome to Go programming.")
	//fmt.Println("I hope you have a great time learning Go!")

	//declare a variable
	// var = varialible devclaration
	// whatToSay = variable name
	// string = data type
	// "Hello, Priyansh!" = value assigned to the variable
	var whatToSay string
	whatToSay = "Hello, Priyansh! again"

	//Another way to declare and assign value to a variable
	// whatToSay := "Hello, Priyansh! again"
	//:= is a shorthand for declaring and assigning a variable in one line
	//This is only allowed inside functions

	myName := "Priyansh"
	fmt.Println("My name is", myName)

	sayHelloWorld(whatToSay)
}

func sayHelloWorld(whatToSay string) {
	fmt.Println(whatToSay)
}




QQ. How to create our own package in Go Lang?

- Before creating a new package, we have to do some changes in our application. for that:
- go to terminal/command prompt and run below command:
	go mod init myapp (myapp is the app name)
- it creates a new file called go.mod
- go.mod file holds the app details and version details in it
- download doctor.go file -> cory in notpad
- create a new folder in Go_Lang folder with named doctor
- create a new file in this folder named doctor.go and paste the whole text into this file and save it.

func Intro() string{
	return
} // this function intro doesn't take any parameter as input but returns string.

- now call the function from doctor.go file.
- as it's not imported so we have to create our own package and have to import it

*********

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"myapp/doctor"
) // immporting multiple packages at the same time.

func main() {

	var whatToSay string

	/* Intro returns the intro text
	   This Intro function doesn't take any parameters and returns a string. this function is defined in doctor.go file

	   func Intro() string {
	   	return `
	   I'm Eliza
	   ---------
	   Talk to the program by typing in plain English, using normal upper
	   and lower-case letters and punctuation.  Enter 'quit' when done.

	   Hello. How are you feeling today?`
	   }
	*/
	whatToSay = doctor.Intro()

	fmt.Println(whatToSay)

}
